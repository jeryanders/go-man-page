# Build your own custom Linux Manual page with Go.

Have you ever wanted to stand out from the crowd during an interview process and show just how much you love Linux? Have you ever wanted to display your enumerated credentials in a classic, elegant way? Then this repo is right for you. Clone it, modify the `data.GetManPage()` func and run it. Host it, point your domain to it, and revel in the nerd cred of having your resume in a way that says "I love what I do!"
