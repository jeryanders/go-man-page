## Impress hiring teams with a custom Linux Manual page with Go.

Have you ever wanted to stand out from the crowd during an interview process and show just how much you love Linux? Have you ever wanted to display your enumerated credentials in a classic, elegant way? Then this repo is right for you. 

Clone it, modify the `data.GetManPage()` func (or customize your own data source), run it, host it, point your domain to it, and revel in your nerd cred by having your resume displayed in the way everyone who stayed up late hacking through linux grew to love.

### Notes
For commedic purposes only. Use of this to promote your nerdliness will not guarantee placement in any job. Not to be used as a complete substitution for a professionally type-set resume in `LaTeX` or `Word`. While other nerds will grok the aesthetic, hiring teams are likely non-technical and won't understand this. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
